# ANALYSING SPATIAL-TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF CRIME HOTSPOTS AND THEIR RELATED FACTORS USING DECISION TREE TECHNIQUE

# BACKGROUND
* The use of hotspot mapping has gained its popularity both from crime prevention, practitioners and academics.
* In some western countries such as England, the U.S., and Australia, hotspot mapping techniques have been increasingly adopted by law enforcement agencies and police officers.
* Only a limited number of studies have so far dealt with these issues.

Such as there are several maps applications that show the exact crime location along with the crime type for any given city. Even though crime locations have been identified, there is no information available that includes the crime occurrence date and time along with techniques that can accurately predict what crimes will occur in the future.

# Spatial Temporal
Spatiotemporal data analysis is an emerging research area due to the development and application of novel computational techniques allowing for the analysis of large spatiotemporal databases. Spatiotemporal models arise when data are collected across time as well as space and has at least one spatial and one temporal property. An event in a spatiotemporal dataset describes a spatial and temporal phenomenon that exists at a certain time t and location x.

# Crime Analysis
Crime analysis is a set of processes applied on relevant information about crime patterns. Administrative and operational personal can use the result of analysis to prevent and suppress of criminal activities and also for investigation aims.
When crime analysts in law enforcement agencies conduct crime analysis, including crime prediction, a key element centers on where crimes tend to occur. Like some other human involved activities (traffic accidents, disease outbreaks, gentrification, etc.), crime incidents are not distributed randomly throughout space. Their distribution is dense at some locations while sparse at others.

# Decision Tree
A decision tree is a map of the possible outcomes of a series of related choices. It allows an individual or organization to weigh possible actions against one another based on their costs, probabilities, and benefits. They can be used either to drive informal discussion or to map out an algorithm that predicts the best choice mathematically. 
A decision tree typically starts with a single node, which branches into possible outcomes. Each of those outcomes leads to additional nodes, which branch off into other possibilities. This gives it a treelike shape.
The concept of a hotspot is widely used in our daily life. Being aware of which places are safer and which places are with a higher risk of being a victim of crime, people visit or live in some locations while they avoid others. Based on the knowledge of risks of victimization, people make choices of the communities they live in, the schools they send their children to, or the recreation 0area they spend their weekend in, etc.
Hotspot mapping is an effective and widely used analytical technique which uses retrospective crime data to identify crime hotspots. Crime maps are becoming significant tools in crime and justice. Advances in the areas of information technology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have opened new opportunities for the use of digital mapping in crime control and prevention programs. Crime maps are also valuable for the study of the ecology and the locational aspects of crime. Maps enable areas of unusually high or low
concentration of crime to be visually identified. Maps are however only pictorial representations of the results of more or less complex spatial data analyses.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our research aims to find spatial and temporal criminal hotspots using a set of real-world datasets of crimes. It tries to locate the most likely crime locations and their frequent occurrence time. In addition, predict security needed areas in a specific location within a particular time. Finally, it is intended to provide an analysis study by combining our findings of a particular crimes dataset with its demographics information.

# OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this project:
* Extraction of crime patterns by analysis of available crime data.
* Crime analysis based on factors mentioned below:
i. Area wise crime ratio.
ii. Finding rate of most committed crime.
iii. Secure and unsecure areas.
iv. Security needed areas.

# SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
* Analysis of available limited data (in terms of cities/crime).
* Only text formatted data (no official footage or pictorial data of crime reported).
* No analysis of criminal data.
* No detection of fake data (if provided).
